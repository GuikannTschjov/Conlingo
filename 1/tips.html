<h1>About Patchélogue</h1>

<p><u title="/ˌpǝˈtʃeɪlɔg/, Vżɑƞı̣nṣK/pʰɐˈtʃʰɛlok̚/, lit.“Language of patchouli”">Patchélogue</u> is a <a href="https://en.m.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed language</a> created as a hobby, by Kaihan Zhang, a Chinese student. It’s set to be spoken in a vast and powerful empire in an parallel universe. <i>Cliché</i>, innit?</p>

<p>Since it’s speakers are in a parallel universe where latin letters never existed, they don’t actually call their language by this western-y name “Patchélogue”. No, that’s just the author’s fancy anglolization of the phonetic transcription “Patshélog”.</p>

<p>And, yes, the language is named after <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Patchouli_Knowledge">Patchouli Knowledge</a>.</p>

<h2>When “y” Means “f” — Patchélogue Letters</h2>
<p>Patchélogue is written in an alphabet called <i><u title="ᖷiĸinżıZ̄/çic⁼iˈlaja/, lit.“Script of saint”">“Higilaya”</u></i>. It was created by a group of ancient barbarians who, conincidentally, discovered some English comic books left by a time-traveller. That’s why there are letters identical to Latin ones and pronounced differently.</p>

<p>The biggest feature of <i>Higilaya</i> letters is that, when turned upside-down, every letter became another letter. For example: turn “ʎ⟨m⟩” upside-down and you get “y⟨f⟩”. It’s like Arabic numeral “9” and “6” or <u title="Except “q” and “b” are pronounced /s/ and /n/ in Patchélogue, as you’ll learn later.">Latin letter “q” and “b”</u> but taken to eleven. </p>

<h2>Plenty Plurals</h2>

<p>In this course, you add a -ʎ⟨-m⟩ to make a noun plural, but it’s not always like that. For “unconscious” nouns, you add a -q⟨-s⟩. You’ll learn this grammar aspect and the letter later.</p>
