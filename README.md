# Conlingo
A rip-off version of the world-famous language-learning app, Duolingo. It tends to teach the user my conlang, Patchélogue, in the Duolingo way.

If I ever translate this project into Chinese, I'd name it “坑邻国”(Keng1 lin2 guo2). It means a “坑爹” version of “多邻国”.

Send me an issue if I ever misspell “-lingo” as “-linguo” again.
