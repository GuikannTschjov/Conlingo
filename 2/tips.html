<h2>Turning and Streching — Four of a Kind</h2>
<p>You’ve seen how the letters “ʎ⟨m⟩”, “y⟨f⟩”, and “ʌ⟨b⟩” resemble each other, but <u title="Actually, you have! In case you forgot, it’s at quiz 9.">have you met “v⟨p⟩”?</u> Now getting all the pieces together, they surely look related, doesn’t they?</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Unturned, unstreched:<br/>Vv⟨p⟩</td>
        <td>Turned, unstreched:<br/>Λʌ⟨b⟩</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Unturned, streched:<br/>Yy⟨f⟩</td>
        <td>Turned, streched:<br/>⅄ʎ⟨m⟩</td>
    </tr>

<p>That’s the two ways new Higilaya letters were created after the barbarians found the comic books. In the following lesson, you will learn two other “unturned-unstreched” letters ꓘᴚ⟨k⟩ and Πn⟨l⟩. Can you figure out what their “relatives” may look like?</p>

<h2>Turn around!</h2>

<p>In Greek, the letter “sigma” comes in two forms: one that you’ve seen on your physics class, and one word-final form “ς”. Patchélogue does the same thing with Πn⟨l⟩ as well: in the end of a word, the letter turns upside-down and makes a “dark-L” sound! </p>

<p>Unlike Greek sigma, in Higilaya alphabet, Πn⟨l⟩ and Цu⟨lh⟩ are considered different letters. </p>
