<h2>Turning and Streching — Four of a Kind</h2>
<p>You’ve seen how “ʎ⟨m⟩”, “y⟨f⟩”, and “ʌ⟨b⟩” resembles each other, but have you met “v⟨p⟩”? Actually, you have! And if you didn’t notice it at that time, you could’ve guessed its existence by the following patterns,too!</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Unturned, unstreched:<br/>Vv⟨p⟩</td>
        <td>Turned, unstreched:<br/>Λʌ⟨b⟩</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Unturned, unstreched:<br/>Yy⟨f⟩</td>
        <td>Turned, streched:<br/>⅄ʎ⟨m⟩</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>In the following lesson, you will learn a group of two “unturned-unstreched” letters Vv⟨p⟩ and Πn⟨l⟩, one “turned-unstreched” letter Kĸ⟨g⟩, one “unturned-streched” letter ᑫq⟨b⟩, and a not-in-the-pattern vovel letter Īi⟨i⟩. Can you figure out what their “relatives” look like?</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Letter<br/>(Capital, Small)</th>
        <th>Transcription</th>
        <th>Pronounciation<br/>(IPA, English)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Vv</td>
        <td>⟨p⟩</td>
        <td>[p], English /p/ when not after an “s”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Īi</td>
        <td>⟨i⟩</td>
        <td>[i], English “flEEce”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>ᑫq</td>
        <td>⟨s⟩</td>
        <td>[s], English /s/</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Kĸ</td>
        <td>⟨g⟩</td>
        <td>[k⁼], English “sKy”</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Πn</td>
        <td>⟨l⟩</td>
        <td>[l], English non-final /l/</td>
    </tr>

<h2>A Semicolon; a Question Mark? An Exclaimation Mark!</h2>

<p>You may have noticed sentences from last lesson ends in a “comma” like unfinished, and a subscript 9 — or an empty comma — appearing in where you’d expect a comma. And yes, those <i>are</i> periods and commas in Patchélogue!</p> 

<p>Just like Greek and Ethiopian, Patchélogue has a different set of punctuations. Greek use “;” for question marks, and Patchélogue use it for exclaimation marks! There’s even a “exclaimation comma” for sentences like “Hey, you!” that looked like a empty semicolon: “⨟”.</p>
