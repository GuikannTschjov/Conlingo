<h1>About Patchélogue</h1>

<p>Patchélogue(/ˌpʌˈtʃeɪlɒg/, Vżɑƞı̣nṣK/pʰɐˈtʃʰɛlok̚/, lit.“Language of patchouli”) is an <a href="https://en.m.wiki.hancel.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed language</a> created as a hobby, by Kaihan Zhang, a Chinese student. It’s set to be spoken in a vast and powerful empire in an alternative universe. <i>Cliché</i>, innit?</p>

<p>Since it’s speakers are in an alternative universe where latin letters didn’t exist, they don’t actually call their language by this western-y name “Patchélogue”. No, that’s just the author’s fancy anglolization of the phonetic transcription “Patshélog”.</p>

<p>And, yes, the language is named after <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Patchouli_Knowledge">Patchouli Knowledge</a>.</p>

<h2>When “y” means “f” — Patchélogue letters</h2>
<p>Patchélogue is written in <i>Higilaya</i>(ᖷiĸinżıZ̄/çic⁼iˈlaja/, lit."Script of saint"), which looks like Latin letters, because it was created after a group of ancient barbarians discovered some English comic books a time-traveller left.</p>

<p>The biggest feature of <i>Higilaya</i> letters is that, when turned upside-down, every letter became another letter. For example: turn “ʎ⟨m⟩” upside-down and you get “y⟨f⟩”. It’s like Arabic numeral “9” and “6” or Latin letter “q” and “b” but taken to eleven, except “q” and “b” are pronounced /s/ and /n/ in Patchélogue, as you’ll learn later. </p>
