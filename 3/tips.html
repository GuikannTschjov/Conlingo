<h2>Gender but it’s about Consciousness Instead</h2>

<p>There are 2 genders in Patchélogue, which is not divided by sеx but by consciousness. It should be noticed that a noun's gender isn't fixed. For example, a vehicle can be conscious when operated by a driver, a person can be unconscious when being knocked out.</p>
